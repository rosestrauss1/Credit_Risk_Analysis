# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias. This analysis was used to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

* Naive Random Oversampling: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
* SMOTE Oversampling: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
* Undersampling Results: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
* Comination Results: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier Results: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier Results: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
