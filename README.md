# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias. This analysis was used to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:

* Naive Random Oversampling: The balanced accuracy score is . The precision is and the recall score is .
