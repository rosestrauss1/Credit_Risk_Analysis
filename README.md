# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias. This analysis was used to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

* Naive Random Oversampling
* SMOTE Oversampling
* Undersampling Results
* Comination Results
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier Results
* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier Results



## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
